# Dev Tooling — Claude Code skills + MCP servers

Referenced from [`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md) § Dev Tooling. This file holds the detail; CLAUDE.md holds the compact routing. When these two drift, this file wins.

All recommendations trace back to [`../../jaan-to/docs/research/23-ai-workflow-claude-skills-go-clickhouse-analytics.md`](../../jaan-to/docs/research/23-ai-workflow-claude-skills-go-clickhouse-analytics.md) (doc 23). We do **not** restate the research here — only decisions and deviations.

## Install summary

**4 skill collections installed (32 atomic skills total — 2 over doc 23 §Best Practices soft cap of 30; the `static-analysis` plugin nests 3 sub-skills, codeql/semgrep/sarif-parsing, all relevant to Phase 2):**

| Collection | Source | License | Skills installed | Phase coverage |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| cc-skills-golang | [samber/cc-skills-golang](https://github.com/samber/cc-skills-golang) | MIT | 12 of 37 (curated) | 0, 1, 3, 6, 7 |
| clickhouse-agent-skills | [ClickHouse/agent-skills](https://github.com/ClickHouse/agent-skills) | Apache-2.0 | 1 primary (`clickhouse-best-practices`, 28 rules/11 categories) + 4 auxiliary (`chdb-datastore`, `chdb-sql`, `clickhousectl-cloud-deploy`, `clickhousectl-local-dev`) | 0, 1, 3, 6 |
| trailofbits-skills | [trailofbits/skills](https://github.com/trailofbits/skills) | CC-BY-SA-4.0 | 8 of 38 (curated) | 2 (security) |
| marina-skill | [The-Focus-AI/marina-skill](https://github.com/The-Focus-AI/marina-skill) | MIT | 4 of 4 (all) | 8 (deploy) |

**4 MCP servers configured** in [`.mcp.json`](../.mcp.json): `clickhouse` (Altinity), `gopls`, `hetzner`, `grafana`.

## Licensing decisions

CLAUDE.md § License Rules mandates MIT/Apache/BSD/ISC for anything **in the binary**. Skills and MCP servers are dev-time tooling — not bundled with the shipped binary — so that gate applies to the Go dependency tree, not to this directory. That said, each skill source was verified:

| Collection | License | Verdict | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| cc-skills-golang | MIT | ✅ Install | Green across both bars. |
| clickhouse-agent-skills | Apache-2.0 | ✅ Install | Green across both bars. |
| marina-skill | MIT (declared in README, no LICENSE file) | ✅ Install | Declared MIT; safe for dev-time. |
| trailofbits-skills | CC-BY-SA-4.0 | ⚠️ Install unmodified | Dev-time documentation only. Share-alike applies to modifications, so we ship these verbatim. If we need to modify a ToB skill, fork & publish under CC-BY-SA. |
| darrenoakey/claude-skill-golang | **CC-BY-NC-4.0** | ❌ **Rejected** | Non-commercial only. statnive-live is sold commercially (SaaS + self-hosted license fee). Functionality overlap with cc-skills-golang (testing, linter) is substantial — no meaningful loss. |

Doc 23 originally recommended claude-skill-golang; we deviate because commercial-use is non-negotiable. CI gate enforcement (its main value-add) is handled by our own `.githooks/pre-commit` + `make lint` once scaffolded.

## Curated skill list

### cc-skills-golang (12 of 37)

The full repo ships 37 atomic skills. We install only the ones that map to statnive-live phases (Architecture Rule 7 — defer before building):

| Skill | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `golang-concurrency` | Goroutines, channels, errgroup, singleflight — Phase 1 ingestion pipeline |
| `golang-context` | Context propagation, cancellation, deadlines — all phases |
| `golang-database` | Connection pools, `database/sql` patterns — Phase 1, 3 |
| `golang-error-handling` | Error wrapping, sentinel errors, errors.Is/As — all phases |
| `golang-security` | Crypto, hashing, TLS, input validation — Phase 2 |
| `golang-performance` | Profiling, benchmarking, allocations — Phase 1, 7 |
| `golang-code-style` | Naming, formatting, idioms — all phases |
| `golang-cli` | Flag parsing, subcommands, exit codes — Phase 6 config |
| `golang-observability` | `slog`, metrics, traces — Phase 2 audit log, Phase 8 monitoring |
| `golang-project-layout` | Standard Go project layout — Phase 0 |
| `golang-linter` | golangci-lint, staticcheck config — Phase 7 gate |
| `golang-safety` | `unsafe` guidance, race conditions, memory safety — Phase 1, 2 |

**Skipped (no active phase yet):** grpc, samber-do/hot/lo/mo/ro/slog/oops, dependency-injection, dependency-management, design-patterns, documentation, data-structures, benchmark (covered by performance), modernize, naming (covered by code-style), popular-libraries, testing (pending testing framework selection in Phase 7), continuous-integration (our pre-commit hook + Makefile handle it).

### clickhouse-agent-skills (1 primary + 4 auxiliary)

All 5 directories installed. Maps to [CLAUDE.md § Architecture Rules](../CLAUDE.md#architecture-rules-non-negotiable) 1–8. Note: the upstream repo ships **one** skill (`clickhouse-best-practices`, 28 rules/11 categories) — the other 4 entries are related but separate artifacts. See § Doc 28 additions for the full roster correction.

| Skill | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `clickhouse-best-practices` | 28 battle-tested rules — primary-key design, partitioning, data types |
| `clickhouse-architecture-advisor` | 5-framework schema design — informs rollup vs raw, MergeTree variant selection |
| `chdb-datastore` / `chdb-sql` | chDB embedded ClickHouse — useful for unit tests that don't want a real CH server |
| `clickhousectl-cloud-deploy` / `clickhousectl-local-dev` | Deployment helpers — we use local-dev for Phase 1 docker-compose, cloud-deploy may inform Hetzner hosting patterns |

### trailofbits-skills (8 of 38)

The full repo has 38 plugins (many are audit-workflow or niche-language). We install only the security-audit primitives that align with Phase 2:

| Skill | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `static-analysis` | CodeQL + Semgrep + SARIF pipeline — backbone of the security gate |
| `semgrep-rule-creator` | Author custom rules (e.g., forbid `WHERE site_id` absence, forbid `Nullable(`) |
| `differential-review` | Compare pre/post-change security posture — PR review aid |
| `insecure-defaults` | Detects unsafe default config — important for our air-gap-capable binary |
| `variant-analysis` | Find variants of a known bug across the codebase |
| `supply-chain-risk-auditor` | Dependency risk scoring — complements our `go-licenses` MIT/Apache/BSD/ISC gate |
| `audit-context-building` | Structured audit reports — we can seed Phase 2 security review evidence |
| `second-opinion` | Independent review pass on critical security-sensitive code |

**Skipped:** smart-contract, Python, Rust, Chrome-extension, Firebase, iOS/macOS-specific, and meta skills (skill-improver, workflow-skill-design).

### marina-skill (4 of 4)

All installed — already a focused set for the Hetzner deploy path.

| Skill | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `server-management` | Create/list/destroy Hetzner servers |
| `server-bootstrap` | Docker + Caddy + deploy user + unattended upgrades |
| `dns-management` | Cloudflare DNS records |
| `app-deployment` | git-push-to-deploy with Docker Compose |

**Iranian DC caveat:** marina-skill targets Hetzner specifically. For Iranian DC deploys (Filimo production), the skill's Cloudflare DNS piece is unused (Iran routes around Cloudflare), and server-bootstrap's `apt` commands need to run against the Iranian DC's mirror. Expect to fork or custom-script for Iran.

## MCP servers

The MCP servers are configured in [`.mcp.json`](../.mcp.json). They run on the **dev host only** and are never bundled into the analytics binary, so their own license dependencies do not fall under the MIT/Apache/BSD/ISC gate.

### clickhouse (Altinity MCP)

- **Image:** `ghcr.io/altinity/altinity-mcp:latest`
- **Why Altinity over the official `mcp-clickhouse`:** doc 23 recommends Altinity for production-grade deploys — OAuth 2.0, JWE auth, TLS, dynamic tools generated from views, hot reload. The official server is fine for local dev; unifying on Altinity keeps one config path.
- **Required env:** `CLICKHOUSE_HOST`, `CLICKHOUSE_PORT`, `CLICKHOUSE_USER`, `CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD`
- **Setup:** `docker pull ghcr.io/altinity/altinity-mcp:latest` + `docker compose up clickhouse` (from repo root once docker-compose exists).

### gopls

- **Command:** `gopls mcp` — ships natively with recent gopls
- **Install:** `go install golang.org/x/tools/gopls@latest`
- **Capabilities:** govulncheck, test running, coverage, symbol lookup, refactoring

### hetzner (dkruyt/mcp-hetzner)

- **Command:** `mcp-hetzner`
- **Install:** source build from [dkruyt/mcp-hetzner](https://github.com/dkruyt/mcp-hetzner)
- **Required env:** `HCLOUD_TOKEN`
- **Capabilities:** 60+ tools — server provisioning, volumes, firewalls, DNS zones, snapshots, backups

### grafana (grafana/mcp-grafana)

- **Command:** `mcp-grafana`
- **Install:** source build from [grafana/mcp-grafana](https://github.com/grafana/mcp-grafana)
- **Required env:** `GRAFANA_URL`, `GRAFANA_API_KEY`
- **Capabilities:** dashboard queries, Prometheus/Loki/Pyroscope datasources, alerts, incident response

## Phase → tooling map

| 4: Tracker JS | — (no skill; build from scratch per doc 23 gap) | — |
| 5: Frontend | — (no skill; use [`docs/tech-docs/`](tech-docs/) for Preact/uPlot/Frappe/Jalali refs) | — |
| 6: Config | `golang-cli`, `clickhouse-best-practices` | `clickhouse` |
| 7: Testing | `golang-performance`, `golang-linter`, `differential-review`, `second-opinion` | `gopls`, `clickhouse` |
| 8: Deploy | `server-management`, `server-bootstrap`, `dns-management`, `app-deployment` | `hetzner`, `grafana` |

## Known gaps — custom skill TODOs

Per doc 23 §Gap Analysis, these have **no community skill coverage**. Author custom skills only when the corresponding phase opens ([CLAUDE.md § Architecture Rule 7](../CLAUDE.md#architecture-rules-non-negotiable) — defer before building):

| Gap | Phase | Recommended approach |
|---|---|---|
| Vanilla JS <2 KB tracker | 4 | Build from scratch; use `docs/tech-docs/` for `sendBeacon` + IIFE patterns |
| uPlot / Frappe Charts | 5 | Generate on demand from [`docs/tech-docs/uplot.md`](tech-docs/) |
| Jalali / Persian calendar | 5 (v1.1) | Integrate `jalaali-js` (3 KB, MIT) directly |
| WAL durability | 1 | Use `tidwall/wal` library directly; cc-skills-golang concurrency covers the surrounding Go patterns |
| BLAKE3-128 identity | 1 | Use `lukechampine.com/blake3` (MIT) directly |
| Iranian DC deploy | 8 | No community skill. Fork marina-skill or write plain shell scripts against Iranian DC API |

## Maintenance

- **Skill count ceiling (revised):** Doc 23's 30-skill cap was a heuristic. Doc 25 re-evaluates: the trigger-pattern clarity rule matters more than raw count — "install only skills whose trigger patterns you can articulate in one sentence". Post-doc-25, this project runs **~53 skills** (30 doc-23 foundation + 17 community additions + 6 custom). Watch for false activations; remove any community skill that fires on tasks it wasn't designed for.
- **Skill updates:** None of the skills are tracked as git submodules. To update, re-clone the source repo and `cp -R` the updated `skills/<name>/` directory, preserving our `SOURCE` and `LICENSE.source` files.
- **Air-gap invariant:** Skills must not embed remote fetches that execute at load time. Before adding a new skill, grep the SKILL.md for `curl`, `wget`, bare `https://` → the skill may instruct Claude to fetch at runtime, which breaks [CLAUDE.md § Isolation / Air-Gapped Capability](../CLAUDE.md#isolation--air-gapped-capability-non-negotiable).
- **License attestation:** Each skill directory carries a `SOURCE` file (1-liner) and `LICENSE.source` file (full license text from the source repo). These are part of the repo and survive updates.

### Scaffolded-skill activation convention

Custom skills in this project are authored **ahead of** their enforcement phase. A skill's `SKILL.md` body describes the contract it will enforce; its Semgrep rule bodies and CI workflow land when the matching phase opens (e.g. `iranian-dc-deploy` scaffolds in Phase 0, gates from Phase 8). Without a marker, every custom skill would false-activate on every glob match across the intervening phases.

**Convention.** Every custom `SKILL.md` under `.claude/skills/` whose enforcement is scheduled for a future (or currently-mid-implementation) phase prepends a blockquote activation-gate preamble immediately after the `# <skill-name>` heading. Standard shape:

```markdown
# <skill-name>

> **Activation gate (Phase N, <scope>).** This skill's Semgrep rule bodies
> and CI wiring are scheduled for Phase N (<what ships there>). Until the
> corresponding `.github/workflows/<skill>-gate.yml` is green on main,
> treat this skill as **advisory-only** — surface the checklist to the
> reviewer, do not block merges, and flag any mismatch as
> `activation-pending` rather than auto-fixing.

<regular body continues here...>
```

**Scope phrasing options.** Pick whichever fits the skill's lifecycle:
- `Phase N` alone (e.g. `Phase 1`) for skills tied to a single build phase.
- `Phase N, Weeks X–Y` for doc-28-scheduled skills with calendar anchoring.
- `Phase N — partially live` for skills where some rules are live and others aren't (e.g. `wal-durability-review` post-PR #25).
- `advisory-only by design` for skills that ship no Semgrep rules (e.g. `clickhouse-upgrade-playbook`).

**When to remove the preamble.** The operator drops the blockquote when the matching CI workflow is green on main. Not before — and never as part of an unrelated PR; the preamble removal is its own commit so PR review sees the activation event.

**Why this, not `disabled: true` in frontmatter.** Claude Code's schema handling for unknown frontmatter keys is not documented to silently ignore. The blockquote is (a) human-readable in both Claude Code's skill-picker and GitHub rendering, (b) machine-scannable via `grep -l 'Activation gate' .claude/skills/*/SKILL.md`, (c) survives any future frontmatter schema change.

**Current status (as of 2026-04-21):** all 14 custom skills carry the preamble. Inventory:

| Skill | Phase | Gate state |
|---|---|---|
| `tenancy-choke-point-enforcer` | 1 | advisory |
| `air-gap-validator` | 0 (ongoing) | advisory |
| `clickhouse-rollup-correctness` | 1 | advisory |
| `clickhouse-cluster-migration` | 1 lint + P5 upgrade | advisory |
| `preact-signals-bundle-budget` | 4 (tracker) + 5 (dashboard) | advisory |
| `blake3-hmac-identity-review` | 1 | advisory |
| `wal-durability-review` | 7b | **partially live** (Semgrep + kill-9 shipped in PR #25) |
| `ratelimit-tuning-review` | 10 | advisory (HARD GATE pending Filimo cutover) |
| `gdpr-code-review` | 11 | advisory (HARD GATE pending SaaS signup) |
| `dsar-completeness-checker` | 11 | advisory (HARD GATE pending SaaS signup) |
| `iranian-dc-deploy` | 8 W17–18 | advisory (HARD GATE pending Filimo cutover) |
| `geoip-pipeline-review` | 8 W19–20 | advisory |

## Doc 25 additions (Weeks 1–12)

**Summary.** [`jaan-to/docs/research/25-ai-claude-skills-filimo-grade-analytics-platform.md`](../../jaan-to/docs/research/25-ai-claude-skills-filimo-grade-analytics-platform.md) refines doc 23 with a vetted install matrix, an explicit blacklist, and six **mandatory** project-local custom skills that encode the 8 architecture rules from [`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md) as CI-blocking guardrails. 12-week install order front-loads security and tenancy foundations.

**Frontend-design / web-design-guidelines clamp:** both default to CDN fonts. Claude must override to emit Preact-compatible output with self-hosted fonts only — this is enforced by the `air-gap-validator` + `preact-signals-bundle-budget` custom skills.

**Obra/superpowers:** only 5 of 14 skills installed. The remaining 9 (`using-git-worktrees`, `finishing-a-development-branch`, `requesting-code-review`, `receiving-code-review`, `test-driven-development`, `dispatching-parallel-agents`, `writing-skills`, `using-superpowers`, `executing-plans`) are skipped to avoid bloat. Re-evaluate post-launch.

### Custom skills catalog (doc 25 §gap-analysis)

Six `.claude/skills/*` directories scaffolded; bodies fill in per phase. Each has `SKILL.md` (frontmatter + trigger) and `README.md` (full spec).

| Skill | Architecture rule | Trigger | Required before |
|---|---|---|---|
| [`tenancy-choke-point-enforcer`](../.claude/skills/tenancy-choke-point-enforcer/README.md) | Rule 8 | SQL gen/mod in `internal/storage/` | First storage code (merged PR #9) |
| [`air-gap-validator`](../.claude/skills/air-gap-validator/README.md) | Isolation | `go get`, new deps, net code | First `go.mod` addition |
| [`clickhouse-rollup-correctness`](../.claude/skills/clickhouse-rollup-correctness/README.md) | Rule 2 | `AggregatingMergeTree` DDL, MV creation | First MV DDL (shipped in Phase 1) |

| [`blake3-hmac-identity-review`](../.claude/skills/blake3-hmac-identity-review/README.md) | Privacy Rules 2, 3, 4 | Crypto / identity code | First identity code (shipped) |

### Blacklist (do not install)

| Skill | Why |
|---|---|
| `anthropics/skills/web-artifacts-builder` | React 18 + Tailwind + shadcn + Parcel + html-inline — pulls network deps at build, blows past 50KB/15KB-gz dashboard budget. Air-gap violation. |
| `shajith003/awesome-claude-skills` | AI-generated boilerplate; low signal. |
| `sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` | Claims 1,431+ skills, mostly auto-generated duplicates; inflated counts. |
| `rohitg00/awesome-claude-code-toolkit` | Inflated aggregate count, low signal-to-noise. |

### 12-week install order (doc 25 §priority-ranking)

**Week 1 — security & tenancy foundations** (launch-critical):
- `samber/cc-skills-golang` (full bundle — already 12/37 installed; expand to 37 is a follow-up)
- `ClickHouse/agent-skills` (already installed)
- `trailofbits/skills` (already installed + `constant-time-analysis` added by this PR)
- `anthropics/skills` cherry-pick (skill-creator, template, webapp-testing, frontend-design)
- **Custom `tenancy-choke-point-enforcer`** — before any new storage code merges
- **Custom `air-gap-validator`** — before any new dep is added

**Weeks 2–4 — performance & correctness:**
- `JetBrains/use-modern-go`
- `agamm/claude-code-owasp` + `BehiSecc/VibeSec-Skill`
- `obra/superpowers` 5-skill subset
- **Custom `clickhouse-rollup-correctness`** — before any new MV DDL
- **Custom `clickhouse-cluster-migration`** — before any new migration file

**Weeks 5–8 — frontend & crypto hardening:**
- `vercel-labs/agent-skills` (web-design-guidelines primary; react-best-practices for bundle rules)
- `agentskillexchange/knip-unused-code-dependency-finder`
- `izar/tm_skills` (ctm, 4qpytm)
- **Custom `preact-signals-bundle-budget`** — Phase 4/5 load-bearing
- **Custom `blake3-hmac-identity-review`** — Phase 1+ regression guard

**Weeks 9–12 — launch hardening** (not always-on):
- Run `AgriciDaniel/claude-cybersecurity` one-shot pre-launch audit (not installed; invoke from operator Claude session)
- Run `fr33d3m0n/threat-modeling` full STRIDE pass on salt-rotation + air-gap stories
- Defer `tracker-beacon-reliability` custom skill and any other v1.1 skill unless incidents materialize.

### Follow-ups (out of scope for the doc-25 install PR)

- Expand `cc-skills-golang` from 12 → full 37 (doc 25 warns against partial installs).
- Fill in Semgrep rule bodies + test fixtures for the 6 custom skills (40–60 hrs total, scheduled per phase).
- Wire `.claude/settings.json` hooks + `.githooks/pre-commit` to invoke custom skills via `claude-code` headless mode.
- Install one of `qualixar/skillfortify` or `relaxcloud-cn/clawsafety` to vet future community installs (CycloneDX SBOM + `skill-lock.json`).

## Doc 27 additions (close the three gaps)

**Summary.** [`jaan-to/docs/research/27-closing-three-skill-gaps-statnive-live.md`](../../jaan-to/docs/research/27-closing-three-skill-gaps-statnive-live.md) surveys ~2,000 skills across 10 aggregators and confirms that no community skill targets the three surfaces statnive-live most exposes: **WAL durability** (`tidwall/wal` binary format doesn't CRC individual records; fsyncgate 2018 data-loss class on Linux pre-4.13), **CGNAT-aware rate limiting** (Iranian AS44244 / AS197207 / AS57218 NAT444 makes 100 req/s per-IP catastrophic), and **GDPR on append-only HyperLogLog** (row-level erasure impossible by design; defensible legal position uses Recital 26 + C-413/23 + weekly rollup rebuild).

### Three opinionated defaults (adopt)

- **(a) WAL: ack-after-fsync with group commit.** One goroutine fsyncs every 100 ms; all waiting handlers return 200 together. ~50 ms p50 latency cost is within the 500 ms p99 SLO. Only config that honors the kill-9 guarantee as worded. Phase 7b gate.
- **(b) Rate limit: Iranian-ASN-aware tiering.** Compound key `(ip, site_id)` at 1 K req/s sustained / 2 K burst for AS44244 / AS197207 / AS57218; 100/200 fallback elsewhere; per-`site_id` global ceiling 25 K req/s. ASN DB: **`iptoasn.com`** public-domain TSV. Phase 10 cutover gate.
- **(c) GDPR: declare HLL rollups anonymous under Recital 26.** DPA language + weekly rollup rebuild as bounded-time (max 1 week) compliance safety net. Phase 11 signup gate.

### ASN-DB licensing decision (rules out MaxMind + IPLocate)

| Source | License | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| MaxMind GeoLite2 (MMDB) | CC-BY-SA-4.0 | ❌ Rejected — share-alike contaminates binary, violates [CLAUDE.md § License Rules](../CLAUDE.md#license-rules-critical) |
| IPLocate.io free DB | CC-BY-SA | ❌ Rejected — same issue |
| **iptoasn.com `ip2asn-v4.tsv.gz`** | **Public domain** | ✅ **Adopted** — hourly-refreshed TSV, TSV loader, operator file-drop matches air-gap rule |

### Adjacent community skills added by doc 27

| Skill | Source repo | License | Install path | Role |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `grc-gdpr` | [Sushegaad/Claude-Skills-Governance-Risk-and-Compliance](https://github.com/Sushegaad/Claude-Skills-Governance-Risk-and-Compliance) (GDPR module only) | MIT | `.claude/skills/grc-gdpr/` | Outer GDPR checklist, findings mapped to Articles |
| `legal-compliance-check` | [anthropics/knowledge-work-plugins](https://github.com/anthropics/knowledge-work-plugins) → `legal/skills/compliance-check` | Apache-2.0 | `.claude/skills/legal-compliance-check/` | Regulatory-review template; seeds Article 28 DPA for SaaS |

**Not installed** (doc 27's `BehiSecc/sanitize` reference — repo does not exist): doc 27 line 7 cites a `BehiSecc/sanitize` skill detecting "15 categories of PII"; `github.com/BehiSecc/sanitize` returns 404 and the org publishes `VibeSec-Skill` + `bugSkills` + `awesome-claude-skills` only. The functional role — last-mile PII grep over audit-log output — is covered by the custom `gdpr-code-review` skill's `semgrep/pii-rules.yml` (TODO, Phase 11) and by the existing [`vibesec`](../.claude/skills/vibesec/SKILL.md) install. Install a real substitute if/when one surfaces.

### Custom skills catalog (doc 27 §gap-analysis)

Four `.claude/skills/*` directories scaffolded; Semgrep rule bodies + test fixtures fill in per phase. Each has `SKILL.md` (frontmatter + 10-/12-item checklist) and `README.md` (full spec + CI wiring + research anchors).

| Skill | Architecture touchpoint | Trigger | Required before |
|---|---|---|---|
| [`wal-durability-review`](../.claude/skills/wal-durability-review/README.md) | Architecture Rule 4 + kill-9 contract | `internal/ingest/{wal,consumer}.go`; `.Sync()` / `.TruncateFront()` call-sites | Phase 7b — fix the 3 WAL gaps from PR #14 |
| [`ratelimit-tuning-review`](../.claude/skills/ratelimit-tuning-review/README.md) | Security #5 + CGNAT SLO | `internal/ratelimit/**`, `httprate` / `x/time/rate` imports, middleware chain | **Phase 10 Filimo cutover — HARD GATE** |
| [`gdpr-code-review`](../.claude/skills/gdpr-code-review/README.md) | Privacy Rules 1–9 + GDPR Art. 4(2), 17, 21 | `internal/identity/**`, `internal/audit/**`, `/api/privacy/*`, tracker JS | **Phase 11 public signup — HARD GATE** |
| [`dsar-completeness-checker`](../.claude/skills/dsar-completeness-checker/README.md) | GDPR Art. 17 sink matrix | New migration + `erase.go` + audit sinks | **Phase 11 public signup — HARD GATE** (pair) |

### CGNAT reality (what the rate-limit skill enforces)

- **AS44244 Irancell** — ~1.3 M IPv4 for tens of millions of subscribers. A single public IPv4 fronts 5 000–10 000 concurrent subscribers at peak.
- **AS197207 MCI** — 828 IPv4 prefixes, no IPv6, entire mobile base.
- **AS57218 RighTel** — smaller but same NAT444 pattern.
- **100 req/s per-IP** throttles an entire apartment block the moment two neighbors load the homepage. Compound `(ip, site_id)` + ASN tier is the only viable shape.

### 3-phase schedule

- **Phase 7b (now)** — author Semgrep body for `wal-durability-review`; wire the kill-9 CI gate; fix the 3 WAL gaps surfaced in PR #14 against this skill's 10-item checklist.
- **Phase 10 (Filimo cutover)** — author ASN-tiered limiter in `internal/ratelimit/tier.go`; wire `iptoasn.com` TSV loader; ship k6 scenarios `normal` / `burst` / `ddos` / `cgnat`; pass this skill's 10-item checklist.
- **Phase 11 (SaaS public signup)** — author `gdpr-code-review` + `dsar-completeness-checker` Semgrep bodies; integration test enumerates `system.tables` dynamically; DPA draft committed at `docs/dpa-draft.md`; weekly rollup rebuild cron scheduled.

### Follow-ups (out of scope for the doc-27 install PR)

- Author `iptoasn.com` TSV loader in `internal/ratelimit/asn.go` (Phase 10).
- Draft DPA §X.Y at `docs/dpa-draft.md` using doc 27 §line 77-79 verbatim (Phase 11).
- Draft `docs/backup-retention.md` documenting backup rotation + erase propagation to next generation (Phase 11).
- Author `FIELDS.md` documenting all 34 EnrichedEvent fields with {purpose, retention, Article-6 basis} (Phase 11).
- Find a real PII-grep community skill to replace the missing `BehiSecc/sanitize` — check Snyk Feb 2026 curation, `BehiSecc/awesome-claude-skills` index, and `mshs01156/support-to-repro-pack` (closest match found; not adopted because it's scoped to bug-triage, not general PII grep).

## Doc 28 additions (close the final three gaps)

**Summary.** [`jaan-to/docs/research/28-geoip-iranian-dc-clickhouse.md`](../../jaan-to/docs/research/28-geoip-iranian-dc-clickhouse.md) confirms **zero public Claude skill coverage** for three statnive-live surfaces (GeoIP pipeline correctness, Iranian DC deployment specifics, ClickHouse operational discipline). Builds four new custom skills, one material policy correction, and one roster correction.

### Policy correction — CC-BY-SA-4.0 carve-out for non-linked data files

Doc 28 §Gap 1 establishes that **every major free city-level GeoIP DB is CC-BY-SA-4.0** (IP2Location LITE DB23, IPinfo Lite, IPLocate free) and GeoLite2 additionally carries a MaxMind EULA that mandates auto-updates (air-gap-incompatible). The project's original strict `MIT/Apache/BSD/ISC` policy was **unsatisfiable** with any of these.

**Resolution** (shipped in [CLAUDE.md § License Rules](../CLAUDE.md#license-rules-critical) — commit `4d26275`): carve-out amendment for *non-linked data files only*. GeoIP BIN databases are data, not linked code — the binary surface gate does not apply. Attribution is delivered in three surfaces (`LICENSE-third-party.md` + `/about` JSON + dashboard footer) enforced by the [`geoip-pipeline-review`](../.claude/skills/geoip-pipeline-review/README.md) skill's Semgrep rule `geoip-attribution-string-present`.

**Alternative (Phase 10 Filimo):** budget for paid IP2Location DB23 Site License — attribution waived per commercial terms. Price is sales-gated; comparable DBs range $99–$980/yr.

### Roster correction — ClickHouse/agent-skills is 1 skill, not 6

The Install Summary table above previously listed `clickhouse-agent-skills` as "6 of 6 (all)". That misrepresents the repo:

- **1 primary skill** — `clickhouse-best-practices` — ships 28 rules across 11 categories (Primary Key, Data Types, JOINs, Insert Batching, Mutation Avoidance, Partitioning, Skipping Indices, Materialized Views, Async Inserts, OPTIMIZE Avoidance, JSON).
- **4 auxiliary artifacts** — `chdb-datastore`, `chdb-sql`, `clickhousectl-cloud-deploy`, `clickhousectl-local-dev` — related but separate. Useful for embedded-CH unit tests (Phase 7) + local-dev setup.

All 5 directories stay installed. The summary row now reads "1 primary + 4 auxiliary" instead of "6 of 6 (all)".

### Custom skills catalog (doc 28 §gap-analysis)

Four `.claude/skills/*` directories scaffolded; Semgrep rule bodies + CI wiring fill in per phase.

| Skill | Architecture touchpoint | Trigger | Required before |
|---|---|---|---|
| [`iranian-dc-deploy`](../.claude/skills/iranian-dc-deploy/README.md) | Isolation + Security #1 (TLS manual PEM) + OFAC 31 CFR 560.540(b)(3) | `deploy/**`, `ops/**`, `infra/**`, DNS zones, TLS/NTP/systemd, `*http.Client`, `internal/license/**` | **Weeks 21–24 Filimo cutover — HARD GATE.** Blocks every Filimo-destined PR after Week 20. |
| [`geoip-pipeline-review`](../.claude/skills/geoip-pipeline-review/README.md) | Privacy Rule 1 (raw IP never persisted) + CC-BY-SA carve-out | `internal/enrich/geoip.go`, `**/*ip2location*`, `cmd/**/main.go`, `internal/about/**`, `LICENSE-third-party.md` | **Phase 10 Filimo paid-DB23 cutover.** CC-BY-SA policy call Week 19 Day 1. |
| [`clickhouse-operations-review`](../.claude/skills/clickhouse-operations-review/README.md) | Architecture Rules 1, 2, 4, 5 + operational defaults | `migrations/*.sql`, `internal/ingest/**`, `internal/query/**`, `config/ch*`, `prometheus/*.rules.yml`, `deploy/backup/**` | **Week 23 load-rehearsal.** Backup-restore drill + parts-ceiling gate. |
| [`clickhouse-upgrade-playbook`](../.claude/skills/clickhouse-upgrade-playbook/README.md) | `{{if .Cluster}}` scope (DDL only, NOT data migration) | `migrations/*.sql`, `migrations/**/*.tmpl` with `Engine=` or `{{if .Cluster}}` | **P5 cluster upgrade.** Advisory only — no Semgrep rules. Paired with `clickhouse-operations-review`. |

### Anti-patterns (doc 28 §Anti-patterns) — also mirrored in CLAUDE.md

Enforced by the custom-skill Semgrep rules above. Listed here for tooling review context:

- **No Cloudflare for any IR-resident code path** (OFAC + no IR POP).
- **No fsnotify for GeoIP reload** — overlayfs/NFS/kqueue silently lose events. SIGHUP only.
- **No `OPTIMIZE FINAL` "with careful review"** — OOMs 8c/32GB under merge pressure. Sanctioned alternative: `OPTIMIZE ... PARTITION '...' FINAL DEDUPLICATE` off-peak.
- **No phone-home license check "even for telemetry"** — OFAC interpretation of "services rendered" excludes commercial services to Iranian entities.
- **No AGPL linked into the binary; no CC-BY-SA except the carve-out for non-linked data files**. OS daemons (chrony, acme.sh, knot, BIND) are operator-installed → outside the boundary.
- **No ACME / Let's Encrypt from inside Iran** — issue outside, rsync PEM inward, SIGHUP swap.
- **`{{if .Cluster}}` is DDL templating only, NOT cluster-upgrade automation.** Data migration is manual via hard-link `ATTACH PARTITION`.

### 3-phase schedule (doc 28 §Full-optimization-roadmap)

- **Weeks 17–18 — `iranian-dc-deploy` first.** Highest dependency chain: blocks every Filimo-destined PR after Week 20. DNS + TLS + blackout-sim CI must be green before any Filimo-specific feature work lands.
- **Weeks 19–20 — `geoip-pipeline-review`.** Depends on `iranian-dc-deploy` (`airgap-update-geoip.sh` lives there). Block Phase 10 paid-DB23 cutover on green Semgrep + hot-reload integration + IP-leak log grep + attribution UI shipped. **CC-BY-SA policy resolution Week 19 Day 1.**
- **Weeks 20–22 (overlaps Filimo rehearsal) — `clickhouse-operations-review` + `clickhouse-upgrade-playbook` paired.** Must be green before Week 23 load-rehearsal at 7K EPS. Backup-restore drill + parts-ceiling CI are the two gates Filimo operations will watch.
- **Weeks 21–24 — Filimo cutover.** Skills act as merge-gates. No custom-skill work during this window; fix bugs only.

### Follow-ups (out of scope for the doc-28 install PR)

- Fill in full Semgrep rule bodies (already written in `semgrep/rules.yaml` per skill; wire into `.github/workflows/*.yml`).
- Author `ops/cert-forge/` Hetzner box provisioning + ACME DNS-01 automation.
- Register `statnive.ir` + `.ایران` IDN bundle at IRNIC (Pars.ir or Gandi; US persons excluded from Gandi per T&Cs).
- Quote Asiatech IRR pricing across AT-VPS-B1 / AT-VPS-G2 / AT-VPS-A1 / dedicated 8c/32GB tiers.
- Quote paid IP2Location DB23 Site License for Phase 10 (Filimo).
- Verify Bunny DNS AXFR-out support (likely unsupported; ClouDNS as AXFR primary instead).
- Place Ed25519 license-signing keypair on offline YubiKey in a non-US, non-Iran jurisdiction (operator decision).
- Decide MiravaOrg/Mirava licence (UNCONFIRMED); wrap functionality in-house if not permissive.
- **Phase 8 skill-roster review** — mid-Phase-8 checkpoint: re-validate each custom skill's trigger globs against real code before its Semgrep body lands. Triggers designed 8 weeks in advance often fire on the wrong globs once real code exists. Scope: all 14 custom skills, cross-check `globs:` in frontmatter vs actual file layout, remove the activation-preamble from any skill whose CI gate went green in the interim. Owner: TBD; blocks Weeks 19–22 body-authoring PRs.

## GeoIP licensing — three-tier posture

Doc 28 §Gap 1 surfaced the CC-BY-SA-4.0 carve-out as a single policy decision. It's really three, one per deployment tier. Each tier has a different legal posture (operator-registered LITE vs paid commercial vs processor-under-GDPR redistribution question). Cross-referenced from [`CLAUDE.md` § License Rules](../CLAUDE.md#license-rules-critical).

| Tier | DB version | License | Attribution surfaces | LITE account owner | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Dev / staging** (Hetzner, all operators) | IP2Location LITE DB23 | CC-BY-SA-4.0 (carve-out) | LICENSE-third-party.md + `/about` JSON + dashboard footer (all three mandatory, verbatim string) | **Each operator registers own** at [lite.ip2location.com](https://lite.ip2location.com) — third-party redistribution forbidden by LITE ToS | ✅ Decided (doc 28 §Gap 1) |
| **Filimo production** (Phase 10 cutover) | IP2Location **paid DB23 Site License** | Commercial | **Waived** per commercial terms | statnive-live org (sales contract) | ✅ Decided — budget for `$99–$980/yr`; Semgrep rule skipped via build tag `licensed_db23` |
| **SaaS tier** (Phase 11+ public signup) | **Decision required** | **Decision required** | **Decision required** | **Decision required** | ⚠️ **Open** — resolve pre-Phase-11 design |

### The SaaS decision — why it's genuinely ambiguous

LITE's ToS explicitly forbids third-party redistribution. For self-hosted customers (current dev/staging tier), that's fine — each operator registers their own LITE account and SCPs their own BIN. For SaaS, we're hosting dashboards on behalf of EU customers and looking up their visitors' IPs against *our* LITE BIN. Two defensible readings:

- **Reading A: we are the data processor, LITE is input data.** No redistribution — we don't ship LITE to the customer; we use it internally, the customer never sees the BIN. This is analogous to how any SaaS uses a proprietary dataset. Processor-DPA language covers the usage.
- **Reading B: serving geo-data in dashboards *is* redistribution.** The API response (`country`, `city`, `region`) is derived from LITE under our license. If a customer's visitor data includes a geo-lookup result, we've effectively redistributed LITE's mapping.

Reading B is the more conservative interpretation. If adopted, SaaS tier must go paid-DB23 from launch, budget accordingly.

**Required before Phase 11 design work starts:**
1. Legal call on Reading A vs Reading B interpretation of LITE ToS.
2. If Reading A holds: processor-DPA draft language explicitly claiming LITE as input data, not redistribution.
3. If Reading B holds: paid DB23 Site License quote for SaaS-tier usage (likely different SKU than Filimo's single-site license).
4. Decide attribution-surface policy for SaaS — even with paid license, the dashboard footer is visible to EU end-users; some operators may want attribution voluntarily retained for transparency.

**Do not** ship the SaaS tier with LITE-and-no-DPA-language. That's the ambiguous middle ground that generates the worst-case legal exposure.
